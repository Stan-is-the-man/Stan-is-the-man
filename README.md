Hi, Iâ€™m Stanislav Yanakiev. Currently available and looking for a new opportunity as a junior developer.

I recently retrained for a new career challenge in the software development with Python programming language and SQL. And I found the right thing for me, that I really enjoy.

I fully realize, that the process of continuously learning new knowledge is a must ! Growing my skill set will keep me competitive. I firmly believe in self-education.
My key to success is attention to every single detail and striving to put all my efforts and energy in the job. I am proactive and reliable employee.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science.
