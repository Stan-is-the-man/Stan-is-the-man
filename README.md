Hi, Iâ€™m Stanislav Yanakiev. Currently available and looking for a new opportunity as a junior developer.

I recently retrained for a new career challenge in the software development with Python programming language and SQL. And I found the right thing for me, that I really enjoy.

Working in sales and distribution helped me to acquire vast experience with problems solving of all types, which will help me in this new role. Managing 5 employee and 250 customers, I learned how to organize and prioritize my tasks, so they would be completed in a timely manner. This helped me to increase the turnover by 15 times, since the beginning.

I fully realize, that the process of continuously learning new knowledge is a must ! Growing my skill set will keep me competitive. I firmly believe in self-education.
My key to success is attention to every single detail and striving to put all my efforts and energy in the job. I am proactive and reliable employee. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python Software Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basic of Data Science.
